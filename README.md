## Acknowledgements

- [CTkColorPicker](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkColorPicker): A much better color picker when it comes to UI than the default Tkinter color picker.
- [pyopengltk](https://github.com/jonwright/pyopengltk): Helped me to actually draw shapes on a tkinter frame using OpenGL. If it wasn't for this I would've moved on to use PyGame for the UI.
